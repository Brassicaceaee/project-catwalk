# project-catwalk

We were tasked with redisgning, from scratch, the products page for an eCommerce company. As a group we created an overview component, related product component, questions and answers component and a reviews and ratings component. React allowed us to implement the requirements quickly and to keep the code maintainable. We were able to use React hooks and context to allow all the components to interface and share the same data.


## Product Overview


## Related Products


## Product Questions and Answers


## Product Ratings and Reviews
The ratings and reviews section provides access to user feedback for the current product. Reviews from other users can be read and new reviews can becreated. Also there is a breakdown of the ratings given for all of reviews and the average score given for the characteristics of the current product.

### Review List
