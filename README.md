## Related Products
Related product widgets consist of two parts. One is the Related products which are related to the item displayed by overview component and it changes accordingly. Having carousel of cards let users navigate between the card. And, upon clicking on a star button a modal would pop up which compares the feature between the related card and the prodcut item. Once a card clicked, it would change the overview item as well. The second part is the outfit section, which is unique to each user. It gives the user the ability to save the current product item and navigating through them.
